## The Project Brief

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they don’t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.

Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.


## The Datasets

You may scrape or make API calls to get additional data, but included in the repository (in the folder `zippedData`) is some movie-related data from:

* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org
* TheNumbers


## Required Python Libraries

The following python libraries have been used as part of this project:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Seaborn
* SQLite3
* Matplotlib
